<h1>Object Streams</h1>

<A NAME="streams, object"></A>
<p>
You may have noticed the class  <code>ObjectOutputStream</code> 
in the previous diagram.
Streams of that class  write objects to a 
destination such as a disk file.
<code>ObjectInputStream</code> streams read objects from 
a source.
So far in our programs objects have existed only in
main memory and lasted only as long the program that
created them was running.
When the program stopped running (or earlier),
they were garbage collected. 
</p>

<p>
With an <code>ObjectOutputStream</code> an object can
be written to disk and will remain there even after
the program stops.
This is the topic of <em>object serialization</em>,
an advanced topic not yet covered in these notes.
