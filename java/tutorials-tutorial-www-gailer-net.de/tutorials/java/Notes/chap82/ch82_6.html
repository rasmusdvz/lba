<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>

Image files, audio files, executable files from other programming languages,
many kinds of data files, ... the list is endless.

<h1>Types of Streams</h1>

<A NAME="streams, types"></A>
<p>
So a stream object may be:
</p>

<ul>
<li>An input stream or an output stream,</li>
<li>a processing stream or an ordinary stream,</li>
<li>a character-oriented stream or a byte-oriented stream,</li>
<li>and may be connected to a variety of sources or destinations.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are many types of streams.
For example, a stream might be an
"input, character-oriented, processing stream".
Another stream might be
"output, ordinary, byte-oriented stream".
Not only are there many types of streams,
there are many ways to connect them together.
The IO aspects of a program may take as much work as
all the rest of the program!
</p>

<p>
This situation is common to all production (industrial strength) programming languages.
IO is a big topic because of the wide variety of IO devices and
the wide variety of data formats.
A production language must be able to read data from sources written by
any language running on any type of computer.
For example,
a program might need to read data 
from magnetic tapes written 30 years ago
by a COBOL program running on an IBM mainframe.
(You would likely use byte-oriented streams for this).
</p>

<p>
The good news is that Java uses the same data formats
for all computers.
If a Java program running on a Macintosh writes a text file, that
file can easily be read by a Java program running on a PC or on
any other computer.
</p>

<p>
This is not true of most other languages.
A "C" program running on one type of computer is unlikely to create
a file that can easily be read by a "C" program running on
another type of computer.
Worse than that, two different "C" compilers for the same computer
are free to use different data formats!

<h3> QUESTION 6:</h3>
<a href="ch82_7.html">
<img src="../nextBut.gif" hspace="5" align="right" border="0"/></a>
<p>
A C++ program running on a DEC mainframe has written a file
of integer data.
Do you think that a C++ program running on a PC can read this file
without trouble?
