<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
Yes.  For example, buffering is useful for output as well as input.

<h1>Character Streams and Byte Streams</h1>

<A NAME="streams, characters"></A>

<p>
<b>Character streams</b> are intended exclusively for character data.
<b>Byte streams</b> are intended for general purpose input and output.
Of course, fundamentally all data consist
of patterns of bits  grouped into 8-bit bytes.
So, logically all streams could be called "byte streams".
However streams that are intended for bytes that represent
characters are called "character streams"
and all others are called "byte streams".
</p>

<p>
Character streams are optimized
for character data and perform some other useful 
character oriented tasks
(more on this later).
Often the source or destination of a character stream is
a text file,
a file that contains  bytes that represent characters.
</p>

<p>
So far in these chapters programs have done IO
only with character data 
(usually with the keyboard as the source and the monitor as the destination).
However, data sources and destinations often contain
non-character data.
For example, the bytecode file created by the Java
compiler contains machine instructions for the Java virtual
machine.
These are not intended to represent characters,
and must be input and output using byte streams.

Think of another type of file that does not contain character data.
