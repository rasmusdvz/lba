<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
Because decimal-based floating point numbers have the same problems,
but with different numbers.

<h1>Graph of Sin(x)  Applet</h1>

<p>
For example <code>1.0/3.0 == 0.3333333.....33333</code> without end.
All floating point schemes have this problem.
Since binary has so many other advantages,
most computers use it.
Electronic calculators sometimes use hardware decimal-based
calculations since they always
present their results to humans.
Also mainframe computers usually include hardware decimal-based
instructions for use in financial calculations.

Let us graph the sine of <code>x</code>, for <code>x</code> in the range
of 0.0 to 2 PI radians.
Here is a start on doing this.
The value of PI is part of the class <code>Math</code>.
You get it with <code>Math.PI</code>.
To get accurate results,
let us use an increment of 1 over a power of two.
(If you have not read the chapters on applets,
you can skip the rest of this chapter with little loss.)

<pre class="program">
// assume that the drawing area is 600 by 400
public class sineWave extends Applet
{

    public void paint ( Graphics gr )
    {
        double inc = 1.0/32.0;
        for ( double x = 0.0; x <= 2*Math.PI; x = x + inc )
        {
          int startX = (int)x;
          int startY = (int)Math.sin( x );
          int endX   = (int)x + inc;
          int endY   = (int)Math.sin( x+inc );
          gr.drawLine( startX, startY, endX, endY );
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
The idea is that each iteration of the loop
will compute two points on the
curve <code>sin(x)</code> and connect them with a line.
If the separation between all the points is small,
all the straight lines will look like a curve.
The various floating point values (such as <code>x</code>)
are cast into <code>int</code> because that type is what
<code>drawLine()</code> expects.

<p>
(Debugging Practice: )
There is a problem with the code as it is so far.
Can you find it?
Hint: consider the values that <code>sin(x)</code> will have.
