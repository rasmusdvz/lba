<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
All three aspects of controlling the loop...
</p>

<ol>
<li>Initializing the loop,</li>
<li>testing the ending condition, and</li>
<li>changing the condition that is tested,</li>
</ol>

<p>
...are set up in one statement.
This makes it easier to check if you have done things correctly.

<h1>Declaring the Loop Control Variable</h1>
<A NAME="for statement, local loop control variable"></A>

<p>
But there is another (less important) aspect of loop control:  
<em>declaring</em> the loop control variable.
For example, here is a counting loop:
</p>

<pre class="code">
int count;

. . . . . .

for ( count = 0;  count &lt; 10; count++ ) 
  System.out.print( count + " " );
</pre>

<p>
The loop control variable <code>count</code> is declared somewhere else in
the program (possible many statements away from the <code>for</code> statement).
This violates the idea that all the loop control is in one statement.
It would be nice if the declaration of <code>count</code> were part of the
<code>for</code> statement.
In fact,
this can be done, as in the following:
</p>

<pre class="code">
for ( <font color=blue>int</font> count = 0;  count &lt; 10; count++ )
  System.out.print( count + " " );
</pre>

<p>
In this example, the declaration of  <code>count</code> and its initialization
have been combined.
However,
there is an important difference between this program fragment and the previous one:
</p>

<A NAME="for statement, scope of loop control variable"></A>
<A NAME="scope, for variable declared in a for statement"></A>

<blockquote>
<b>Scope Rule:</b> a variable declared in a <code>for</code> statement can only be
used in that statement and the body of the loop.
</blockquote>

<p>
The following is <b>NOT</b> correct:
</p>

<pre class="code">
for ( <font color=blue>int</font> count = 0;  count &lt; 10; count++ )    
  System.out.print( count + " " );

// NOT part of the loop body
System.out.println( "\nAfter the loop count is: " + <font color=blue>count</font> );  
</pre>

<p>
Since the <code>println()</code> statement is not part of the loop body,
it cannot use <code>count</code>.
The compiler complained that it "cannot resolve the symbol" when it sees the
<code>count</code> that is outside of the scope of the declaration.
This can be a baffling error message if you forget the scope rule.

Is the following code fragment correct?

<pre class="code">
int sum = 0;
for ( int j = 0;  j &lt; 8; j++ )
    sum = sum + j;

System.out.println( "The sum is: " + sum );
