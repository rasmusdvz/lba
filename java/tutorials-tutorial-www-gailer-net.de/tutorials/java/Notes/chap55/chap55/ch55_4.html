<h1>Event-driven Programming</h1>

<A NAME="event"></A>
<A NAME="event-driven programming"></A>
<p>
When you perform an action on a graphical component you 
generate an <b>event</b>.
In <b>event-driven programming</b> the program responds to events.
The program responds to events that the user 
generates in interacting with  GUI components.
The order of events is controlled by the user.
</p>

<form>
<p>
For example, you can 
generate an event by clicking on this button: &nbsp;
<input type="button" value="Generate an Event" 
onClick="alert('The browser has just handled your event.')">&nbsp;
Or you could click on this button:&nbsp;
<input type="button" value="Generate another Event" 
onClick="alert('The browser has just handled another event.')">&nbsp;
Click on the buttons a few more times
in any order.
The program (your Web browser, in this case)
responds to whatever events you generate.
</p>

<p>
If your browser is written in Java, then Swing components
generate the events and Java methods respond to them.
If your browser is written in C++, then other
components and methods, similar to Swing, are being used.
(Most browsers are written in C++).
