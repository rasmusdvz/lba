<h1>AWT Hierarchy</h1>
<A NAME="AWT Hierarchy"></A>

<p>
The Java AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) contains the 
fundamental classes used for
constructing GUIs.
The  abstract <code>Component</code> class is the base class for the AWT.
Many other AWT classes are derived from it.
(We will not look at most of these classes).
</p>

<p>
Here is a diagram that shows how the classes of the AWT and
Swing fit together.
Look it over to get an overview.
Refer back to it occasionally as you read the material.
</p>

<p>
Some of the AWT classes derived from <code>Component</code>
are <code>Button</code>, <code>Canvas</code>, and <code>Container</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <b><code>JComponent</code></b> class 
is derived from <code>Container</code>
and is one of the <u>base classes</u> of Swing.
The <b><code>JFrame</code></b> class
is derived from the AWT <code>Frame</code> class.
It is usually the main container for a GUI application.
</p>

<p>
The <b><code>JApplet</code></b> class
is sometimes used for Applets on the Web. 
But the 
<b><code>Applet</code></b> 
class is used more frequently.
