<div class="answer">
<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
Yes, for the figure the <code>mouseOver</code> event is ignored.
</p>

<p>
No, for the button the <code>mouseOver</code> event changes the  mouse
pointer from an arrow to a hand.
(Some browsers don't do this.)
</p>

<p>
Of course, when you click the button this
is another kind of event,
and is not ignored, either.

<h1>Three Parts of a GUI Program</h1>
<A NAME="GUI program, three tasks"></A>

<p>
A GUI program consists of three types of software:
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Graphical Components</b> that make up the Graphical User Interface.</li>
<li><b>Listener methods</b> that receive the events and respond to them.</li>
<li><b>Application methods</b>  that do  useful work for the user.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The graphical components are Swing objects.
You either use then as they are defined or extend them into
your own classes.
Listener methods and application methods are Java methods that you
write.
Listener methods respond to events by calling
application methods.
Application methods are
ordinary Java methods that perform useful computations.
They receive data from the GUI and send data to the GUI to be
displayed, but are  not usually themselves conderned with
the user interface.
</p>

<p>
Your Web browser has components 
(such as the "back" and "forward" buttons),
listener methods that receive events 
(such as a click on the "back" button)
and application methods that do useful things
(such as moving back or forward one page.)
</p>

<p>
To write a GUI application, 
keep the three types software
separated
(while keeping the big picture in mind.)
In a big software project  an entire 
team of programmers is assigned to each of the tasks.

<p>
Consider a radio and its user interface.  Match each
part of the radio with its analogous part in a GUI application.
