Can a container contain a container?

<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
Yes. You see this when the main window of a browser
contains frames, which themselves contain other components.

<p>
The component classes that make up the AWT and Swing are
related to each other by inheritance.
When you learn new GUI components it is important
to see how they relate to other components.
</p>

</ANSWER>

<LESSON>
<A NAME="Object class"></A>
<p>
In Java,
there is a pre-defined class that is the ultimate ancestor of all other classes.
This class is called <code>Object</code>.
<code>Object</code> defines the basic nature of all Java objects.
Much of what goes on behind the scenes when a Java program is running
is defined by <code>Object</code>.
</p>

<p>
So, for example a small part of the Java class hierarchy looks like this:
</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="javaHierarchyA.gif">
</div>

<p>
The "clouds"   convey the idea that these are class
definitions, not objects.
The diagram shows that the classes <code>Boolean</code>, <code>Character</code>,
<code>Component</code>, <code>String</code>, and many others
have <code>Object</code> as a direct ancestor.
The  cloud for the <code>Component</code> class is dotted
to show that it is an <em>abstract</em> class.
