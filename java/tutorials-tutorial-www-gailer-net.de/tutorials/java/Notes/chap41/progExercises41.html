<center><h1>  
Chapter 41  Programming Exercises </h1></center>

<blockquote>
Many of your programs from previous chapters
can modified by changing <code>while</code> loops
into the equivalent <code>for</code> loops.
Some of these exercises are repeats of previous ones.

<h2>Exercise 1 --- Sheep Herd Size</h2>
<p>
A breeding group of 20 bighorn sheep is released in
a protected area in Colorado.
It is expected that with careful management the
number of sheep, <code>N</code>, after  <code>t</code>
years will be given by the formula:
</p>

<pre>
N = 220/(1 + 10(0.83)<sup>t</sup> )
</pre>

<p>
and that the sheep population will be able to
maintain itself without further supervision once
the population reades a size of 80.
</p>

<p>
Write a program (using a <code>for</code> loop)
that writes out the value of  
<code>N</code> 
for  
<code>t</code>
starting at zero and going up to 25.
How many years must the sheep heard be
supervised?
</p>

<p>
Hint: don't calculate <code>(0.83)<sup>t</sup></code>
&nbsp; "from scratch" each time the formula is used.
Use a variable <code>power</code> that is multiplied by
0.83 in each iteration of the loop.
What value should it be initialized to?

<h2>Exercise 2 --- Maximum of Integers in a File</h2>
<p>
Write a program that reads 5 integers from a file,
computes their
and their maximum and prints these values
to the screen.
Do this by modifying the summing program
from the chapter.
Insert a new <code>int</code> variable
called <code>max</code> which you should initialize to
the first value in the file.
This will call for an extra set of input statements
before the loop starts.
To compute the maximum you will need an <code>if</code>
statement nested inside the loop.
