<h1> CHAPTER 86 &#8212; Reading Binary Files</h1>

<p>
Recall that <em>binary files</em> are those whose
bytes might hold any possible pattern.
Binary files store
data that has not been translated into character form.
Of course, 
a binary file can store character data mixed in with its other data types.
A file that exclusively stores character data is
called a <em>text file</em>.
</p>

<p>
The subclasses of <code>InputStream</code>
are designed for byte-oriented input from any source.
For use, the source will usually be a file on the hard disk.
But other sources of data can also 
be connected to a program as an <code>InputStream</code>.

While examining a hard drive
that you
found in a junk box
you find a mysterious file.
It looks like it might be a file of 32-bit integers.
Can you write a Java program to read it?
