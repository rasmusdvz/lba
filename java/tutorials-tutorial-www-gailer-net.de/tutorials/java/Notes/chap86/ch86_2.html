<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>

<p>
Yes. Even if the file was not written by a Java program
you can write a program to input the raw bytes and
arrange them into what (you guess) is their intended order.

<h1>InputStream</h1>

<A NAME="InputStream"></A>
<p>
To read a file about which you have little information
you need to make some intelligent guesses.
If the file was written by a Java program then
you need to know what data type is used
in the file. 
Then you can use a subclass  of <code>InputStream</code>
to read bytes for that data type.
If the file contains several data types and
you don't know the order they were written,
the problem is more difficult.
</p>

<p>
The diagram shows <code>InputStream</code> and some of
its subclasses.

<p>
Not all of these streams are concerned with input
from disk files.
For example, <code>PipedInputStream</code> 
represents data coming in from another running program.

what input stream do you suspect will be useful?
