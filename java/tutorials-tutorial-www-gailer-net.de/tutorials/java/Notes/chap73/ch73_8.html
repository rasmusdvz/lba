<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
No.  Now each activation of <nobr><code>Pyramid()</code></nobr> will first activate
<nobr><code>Triangle()</code></nobr> 
before it activates another <nobr><code>Pyramid()</code></nobr>.
</p>

<p>
The complete diagram (showing all activations) will be the same, but the
order will be different.

<p>
Play with the activation diagram again and pay attention
to what circles are active and inactive.
</p>

<p>
Although the complete diagram shows several branches,
there is never more than a single chain of activations.  Where there is
a branch in the complete diagram, only one branch or the other is active
at any point in time.
</p>

<p>
The activation chain is always a singly-linked chain.  In the diagram the
active circles have a solid color.  The formerly active circles are dotted.
The solid colored circles form a singly-linked chain.
</p>

<p>
The activation chain behaves like the type of data structure known as
a <b>stack</b>.
A stack is a linear arrangement of data that grows and shrinks, always at the end.
Stacks are an important topic in Computer Science and in the course
<em>Data Structures</em>.

<p>
Most computers have only one processor in them.
Say that your program is running and that there are several activations
on the activation chain.
</p>

<p>
Which activation on the chain represents the code that the processor
is actively executing?
