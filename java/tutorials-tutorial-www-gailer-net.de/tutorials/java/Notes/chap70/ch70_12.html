<h1>Flaky Version of Recursion</h1>

<A NAME="snowflake"></A>
<p>
A new snowflake picture is formed by drawing a small star at the
end of each exposed line of the previous picture:
</p>

<p>
Here (again) are the two things that recursion does:
</p>

<!-- parts to recursion -->
<ol>
<li>If the problem is easy, solve it immediately.</li>
<li>If the problem can't be solved immediately,
    divide it into smaller problems, then:
    <ul>
    <li>Solve the smaller problems by applying this procedure to each of them.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
Here are how this applies to the snowflake problem:
</p>

<ol>
<li>To draw a tiny snowflake, draw a tiny star.</li>
<li>To draw a large snowflake, draw a large star, then
    draw a half-sized snowflake at the end of each line.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This snowflake drawing procedure stops when the sub-snowflakes
reach the smallest size.
In nature, if the flake remains in the atmosphere for long the ice crystals
keep growing and the flake fills in.  Or if flake
reaches ground before this happens it has an open structure like our snowflake.

<div class="question">
<h3> QUESTION 12:</h3>
<a href="ch70_13.html">
<img src="../nextBut.gif" hspace="5" align="right" border="0"/></a>
<p>
Must each sub-snowflake be half the size of the parent flake?
