(<b>Review:</b> ) IO streams are either character-oriented or byte-oriented.
Character-oriented IO is specialized for handling character data.
Byte-oriented IO is general purpose IO that involves
all types of data.
This chapter does character-oriented output to a disk file
and uses a <code>Writer</code> stream.

It looks like a class that descends from <code>Writer</code>
is what you want.
You can look under <code>Writer</code> 
in the Java documentation for
to find the class you need.
Do that now, on your own hard disk
if you can.
Or look here:

<p>
Look under "All Classes" then "java.io" then "Writer".
Find a class that might be good for writing to a disk file.
When you do this,
notice how the object-oriented idea of inheritance
guides you to the information that you need.
