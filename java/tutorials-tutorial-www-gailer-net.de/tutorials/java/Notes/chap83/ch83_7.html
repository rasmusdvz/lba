<h1>Closing a File</h1>

<A NAME="close, file"></A>
<p>
Computer terms often come from business.
Early computer files imitated the paper files
of the time.
Closing a file means gathering up everything
that should go into it and filing it away.
</p>

<p>
The <b>close()</b> method should always be used 
when a program is done with a file.
If a file is not closed,
the program might end before the operating system
has finished writing data to the  file.
The  data written to the file might be lost!
</p>

<p>
Or it might not.
Depends on how busy the operating system is.
This is a notorious computer bug!
It can be very frustrating,
because sometimes a buggy program will work correctly,
and sometimes not.
