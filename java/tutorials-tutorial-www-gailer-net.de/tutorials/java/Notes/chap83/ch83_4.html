<!-- ANSWER AREA -->


<div class="answer">
<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
Yes, since <code>FileWriter</code> inherits 
from <code>OutputStreamWriter</code>.
</p>

<!-- LESSON AREA -->
<div class="lesson">
<h1>Example Program</h1>

<p>
The example program 
constructs a <b>FileWriter</b> stream.
This also creates a disk file in the current directory,
named "reaper.txt".
The <code>write()</code> method is
called several times to write characters to
the disk file.
Then the file is closed.
</p>

<pre class="program">
import java.io.*;

class WriteTextFile
{

  public static void main ( String[] args ) throws IOException
  {
    String fileName = "reaper.txt" ;

    FileWriter writer = new FileWriter( fileName );

    writer.write( "Behold her, single in the field,\n"  );  
    writer.write( "Yon solitary Highland Lass!\n"  );  
    writer.write( "Reaping and singing by herself;\n" );  
    writer.write( "Stop here, or gently pass!\n"  );  

    writer.close();
  }
}
</pre>


<p>
Details will be explained in a bit.
For now, copy-paste-save-and-run this program.
<b>Note:</b> each time you run the program it will
delete any existing file named "reaper.txt"
and create a new one.
You might wish to check that the 20 page report
that you wrote last night
is not saved in "reaper.txt".
