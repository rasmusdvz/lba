<div class="answer">
<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
A <b>buffer</b> is a section of memory used as a work area.
</p>

<div class="lesson">
<h1>The <code>BufferedWriter</code> Stream</h1>

<A NAME="BufferedWriter"></A>

<p>
Disk input and output is more efficient
when a buffer is used.
For our small example programs it doesn't
matter much.
However, programs that do extensive IO
should use buffers.
The <b>BufferedWriter</b> stream 
is used for this with a character output
stream.
</p>

<pre class="code">
BufferedWriter(Writer out)  
    Construct a buffered character-output stream 
</pre>


<p>
The constructor is used as follows.
Since <code>FileWrite</code> is a <code>Writer</code>
it is the correct type for the parameter.
</p>

<pre class="code">
BufferedWriter out
   =  new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("stuff.txt"));  
</pre>

<p>
Different operating systems
separate lines of text in different ways.
To the annoyance of programmers everywhere,
Microsoft operating systems use a two byte
sequence at the end of a line of text,
but Unix (and Linux) operating systems use just one byte.
