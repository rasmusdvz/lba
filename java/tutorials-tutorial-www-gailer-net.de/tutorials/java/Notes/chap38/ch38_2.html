<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
In general, a <code>Circle</code> object's data should say where it is,
and it should have methods that draw it.
It should also have one (or more) constructors.

<h1>What is a <code>Circle</code> Object?</h1>
<p>
Let us be more specific about our goal:
</p>

<blockquote>
Design a class for
drawing circles in an applet.
We want several convenient ways
to say were the circles are located.
</blockquote>

<p>
We have an important design decision:
What exactly is a <code>Circle</code> object going to be?
If the applet has 100 circles drawn in it,
is each one an object?
Or is there going to be just one <code>Circle</code> object
that can be regarded as a "drawing tool"
that is moved throught the drawing area as the many circles are
drawn?
</p>

<p>
The answer to this question depends on our goal.
As stated,
the goal is to make it convenient to draw many circles.
The drawing will be a static work of "art" that is not used interactively.
Probably the "drawing tool" object is most approriate.
Our <code>Circle</code> object will be like
a plastic template with circles of various sizes
used with pencil and paper to draw circles.
