<p>
Most of the programs used to illustrate recursion in the previous
chapters could easily be written using iteration in place of recursion.
Of course, it is always possible to use one instead of the other.
Sometimes iteration is the obvious choice; sometimes recursion.
This chapter discusses two applets that are much easier to write
with recursion.

<p>
You may wish to review the first chapter on applets (chapter 36)
if your recollection of applets is hazy.
