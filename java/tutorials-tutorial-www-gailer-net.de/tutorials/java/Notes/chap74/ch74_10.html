<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
Yes.  The applet that draws the single stars has calculated the
endpoints of all these lines.

<p>
Here is an applet that extends the basic star by drawing
another star centered at the tip of each of the six lines:
</p>

<center>
<table border="border" bordercolor="brown" width="300" height="300">
<tr><td>
<applet code="SnowFlakeStageTwo.class" width="300" height="300">
Loading an Applet....
</applet>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
The new stars are drawn in red.  Each new star partially
overlaps a line of the central star.
This could be avoided by doing more math,
but the the overlap does not hurt.

Can you think of a way to draw a star at the end of each line?
