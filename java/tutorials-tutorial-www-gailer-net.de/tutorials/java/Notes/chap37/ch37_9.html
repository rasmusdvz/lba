<h3>Eine gute Antwort w&auml;re:</h3>
<p>
No.  Using PC Paint, or some other drawing tool would be
a better way to make such a picture.
It is much easier to create a picture
with a painting program than by progamming.

<p>
The reason for these lessons on Java graphics commands was to
show what they do.
Usually they would not be used in drawing a picture
as in this example.
They would usually be used as part of a program that is interacting
with the user or with a file of data to produce a picture.
For example,
to write a painting program in Java,
you would certainly use all of these commands.
</p>

<p>
There  situations where a picture consists of a vast number of
elements that can be computed by a program,
but are too numerous for a human to specify each one with a mouse
or other means.
The next example is a simplified example of this.
