<h1>HEX Dump</h1>

<A NAME="dump, hex"></A>
<p>
Some text editors do something special with binary files.
The editor in the screen shot  below  shows the bit pattern
in each byte of "intData.dat".
This is sometimes called a <b>hex dump</b>
because it shows bit patterns using two hexadecimal characters
per byte.
On a Unix system use the "od" command at the command line.
On a Windows system use <em>Developer Studio</em> (as below) or the free editor
Code-Genie <a href="http://www.code-genie.com/">http://www.code-genie.com/</a>
to see a hex dump.
</p>

<p>
The six zeros at the beginning of the line mean that
the first byte shown is byte zero of the file.
I drew in the red brackets under each integer.
Four integers were written to the file, so there
are four brackets.
Each bracket shows the four bytes of the integer.
Notice that <em>nothing separates the integers!</em>
The bit pattern of one integer follows the next with
nothing in between.
There is no space character or end-of-line character
between the four bytes of each integer.
I knew where to draw the red brackets because
I knew what data the program wrote to the file.
Without knowing this,
there is no way to decide what bytes should be
grouped together.
</p>



<p>
The first variable in the program contained a zero.
The pattern above the first bracket shows the
32-bit pattern that represents zero.
Each "0" in the dump stands for four bits with
value zero.
So the 32-bit pattern for zero is 
<nobr><code>00000000000000000000000000000000</code></nobr>,
that is, 32 zero bits.

<p>
Don't worry about these details;
the idea is to show that the file contains bit patterns
corresponding to the way integers are represented inside
the processor.
You will get much more of this stuff in a course in
assembly language.
</p>

<p>
The second group is a 32-bit representation of one.
The third group represents 255.
The hexadecimal character "F" represents four bits
with value one.
So the value 255 is represented by 24 zero bits followed
by 8 one bits.

What is the 32-bit representation of minus one?
