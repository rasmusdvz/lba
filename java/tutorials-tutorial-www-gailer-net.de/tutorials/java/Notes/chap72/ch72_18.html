<A NAME="Fibonacci, activation chain"></A>

<p>
Say that a <code>main()</code> program has called <code>fib(5)</code>.
The diagram shows the activations, their parameters (in blue),
and their return values (in red).
Pick an activation and study how the activations below it
correspond to the code.
</p>

<center>
<img src="fib0.gif" onClick="loadImage()" />
</center>

<p>
The diagram labeled <em>All Activations</em> shows how each activation
(except for the base cases)
is supported by two other activations.
</p>

<p>
To see the dynamic sequence of activations,
  repeatedly click on the diagram.
A solid circle represents an activation that
is currently computing or waiting for a
result to be returned.
When an activation is shown as a dotted circle,
it has finished its computation and
is "history".  It is no longer on the activation chain.
</p>

<p>
At any time in the execution of <code>fib(5)</code> the activations
that have not yet finished their computation (because they are waiting for a value)
form a single chain.
There is never more than one activation chain.
The activation chain bends left and right, but there is always a single successor
and a single predecessor for each link (except for the first activation and for
the base cases.)

<!-- QUESTION AREA -->
<div class="question">
<h3> FRAGE 18:</h3>
<a href="ch72_19.html">
<img src="../nextBut.gif" hspace="5" align="right" border="0"/></a>
<p>
For <code>fib(5)</code>, 9 activations occur.
Examine the diagram.  Do you imagine that for <code>fib(n)</code> that there
are many more than n activations.
