<h1>Iterative Factorial</h1>

<A NAME="overflow"></A>
<p>
<code>factorial(N)</code> gets very big even for small N.
It soon gets too big to hold in a Java <code>int</code> and wrong answers result.
In fact, 12 is the largest <code>int</code> that will work as an argument.
This situation is called <b>overflow</b>.
The range of values that a Java <code>int</code> can hold is
(roughly) -2 billion to +2 billion.
Overflow happens when a value is computed that is outside of
that range.
</p>

<p>
You could improve the Java method by using <code>long</code> or
perhaps <code>double</code>
in place of <code>int</code>.
This would extend the range of arguments that could be used with it,
but the
range would not be extended very far.
</p>

<A NAME="numerical analysis"></A>
<p>
If a mathematical formula includes the factorial function,
you need to be careful to avoid overflow.
The correct approach is to manipulate the formula until factorial is removed.
Usually this makes the formula less pretty,
but makes it suitable for implementation
in a program.
Topics like these are the subject of <b>numerical analysis</b>,
a common course in a computer science curriculum.
