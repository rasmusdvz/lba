<div class="lesson">
<h1><b><code>align</code></b> and <b><code>cellpadding</code></b></h1>

<table border="border" align="right" cellpadding="5" hspace="10">
<tr> <th>Monarch</th>     <th>Reign</th> </tr>
<tr> <td>William I</td>   <td>1066-1087</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>William II</td>  <td>1087-1100</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Henry I</td>     <td>1100-1135</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Stephen</td>     <td>1135-1154</td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
As with images, it is possible to position 
a table to one side of page and have text 
fill the remaining space.
Do this with the <nobr><code><b>align="right"</b></code></nobr>
(as with images) attribute inside the table tag.
Of course, you can align the table to the left, as well.
</p>

<p>
Another useful attribute to include inside the table tag
is <nobr><code><b>cellpadding="5"</b></code></nobr>.
This places 5 pixels of padding around each data item
in the table.
This was done with the table at right.
</p>

<p>
Also, as with images, put space between the table and
the surrounding text using <nobr><code><b>hspace="10"</b></code></nobr>
and <nobr><code><b>vspace="10"</b></code></nobr> (use whatever values you want).
</p>

<p>
In the following table, experiment with different values for
these  attributes:
</p>

<script language="JavaScript">
function seeItClick( text ) 
{
  var wopts = ""   // window options

  // Build the window options
  wopts += "toolbar=yes,"
  wopts += "location=no,"
  wopts += "directories=no,"
  wopts += "status=yes,"
  wopts += "menubar=yes,"
  wopts += "scrollbars=yes,"
  wopts += "resizable=yes,"
  wopts += "copyhistory=yes"
  wopts += "width=600,height=400"

  win = window.open( "",  "YourHtml",  wopts)
  win.document.open()
  win.document.write( text )
  win.defaultStatus = "Click the close button to exit."
  win.document.close()
}
</script>

<form name="aForm">
<center>

<textarea name="htmlArea" rows="20" cols="70" wrap="physical">
<html>
<head><title>More Table Attributes</title></head>

<body>
<div align="center"><h1>More Table Attributes</h1></div>

<table border align="" cellpadding="" hspace="" vspace="">
    <tr> <th>Monarch</th>     <th>Reign</th> </tr>
    <tr> <td>William I</td>   <td>1066-1087</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>William II</td>  <td>1087-1100</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>Henry I</td>     <td>1100-1135</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>Stephen</td>     <td>1135-1154</td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
Pick "left" , "right" or "center" for the
<code>align</code> attribute.
Fill in an integer value for the other attributes.
Click the button to see the result.
This may seem to be getting complicated.
It is, a little.
But it is certainly much easier than
doing it on a typewritter.
</p>

<p>
In ancient times,
high school women spent hours and hours
learning how to type beautiful business
letters filled with lists and tables.
Men, of course, did important things,
such as spending hours and hours setting type 
for printed pages  filled with lists and tables.
</p>

<p>
<em>My</em> high school
was very modern.
The men took typing class and the women
learned printing.
</p>
<br clear="all" />

<p>
Oddly, and unexpectedly,
forcing men to take typing was perhaps the best
thing the high school could have done
for them.
Who would have thought
that typing would rise to its current
high tech importance?
The women taking
print shop did not fair as well.
