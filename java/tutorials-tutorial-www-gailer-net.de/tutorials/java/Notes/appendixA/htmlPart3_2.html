An applet is a "little application"
that can be run in the context of a web page.

<h1>Adding Applets to a Web Page</h1>
<p>
An applet is an object whose methods are 
run under the control of a web browser.
The web browser acts as a <code>main()</code> method and
calls the applet's methods.
The methods are called
when a web page containing an applet is loaded,
or in response to events such as mouse clicks
or menu selections.
</p>

<p>
Applets do not run by themselves.
They are
run in the context of
a web browser or the <em>appletviewer</em> of the JDK.
</p>

<p>
To include an applet on a web page use the following set of
tags:</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;applet code="MyApplet.class" width="250" height="200"&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The <code><b>width</b></code> and <code><b>height</b></code> give the size of
a rectangle in the web browsers screen that will be used
for the applet.
You cannot omit <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>; but
you can pick any reasonable values you want.
</p>

<p>
The <code>code="MyApplet.class"</code> part names the
compiled bytecodes of the applet that will be run.
With the above form of the <code>applet</code> tag,
the bytecodes must be in the same disk subdirectory
as the web page.
(For details  on how to create applets and how to compile them,
see Part 5 of these Notes).

<a href="htmlPart3_3.html">
<img src="../nextBut.gif" width="71" height="37" hspace="5" align="right" border="0"/></a>
<p>
(Thought Question: ) Why must you tell the browser the width and height of the
area used for the applet?
