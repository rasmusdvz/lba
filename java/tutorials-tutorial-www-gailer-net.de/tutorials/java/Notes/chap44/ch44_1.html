<h1> CHAPTER 44 &#8212; The <code>do</code> Statement</h1>
<p>
Loops are so important, and are so common in programs,
that there are several Java language features
for implementing them.
You have already seen <code>while</code> loops
and <code>for</code> loops.
This chapter looks at <code>do</code> loops.
</p>

<p>
A programming language needs to have
only one general looping method.
In Java, the
<code>while</code> statement can be used to implement any loop.
However, 
as we have seen,
the <code>for</code> statement is  very
convenient.
The <code>do</code> loop is occasionally convenient.
Of the three looping statements, it is used the least.
Some programmers prefer not to use it at all.
</p>

<h4>Chapter Topics:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <code>do</code> statement.</li>
<li>Bottom-driven loops.</li>
<li>Dangers of bottom-driven loops.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <code>do</code> statement is not part
of the  AP (Advanced Placement)
computer science test given to
high school students in the US.
It is not used in the chapters that
follow this one.

<p>
There are several looping statements in Java, 
although only one (any one of them) is logically necessary.
</p>

<form>
<p>
Are there  also  several <em>branching statements</em> in Java?
&nbsp; &nbsp; <input type=button value='Branching?' 
onClick="alert('Branching statements are those that make decisions, such as the if statement')">
