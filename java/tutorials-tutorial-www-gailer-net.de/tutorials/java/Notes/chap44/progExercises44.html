Chapter 44  Programming Exercises</h1></center>

<h2>Exercise 1 --- Input File Prompt</h2>

<p>
Write a class with a <code>main()</code> method that
asks the user for the name of the input file
to be read by the program.
In a practical program, the name would then be
used to access a disk file
(see Part 10 of these notes.)
But for this program just gather the file name.
</p>

<p>
The file name
  must be in the correct format.
  File names consist of two parts, a
  <em>name</em> and an <em>extension</em>.
  The name must not contain spaces.
  The extension must be ".dat" (for "data").
  The user is repeatedly asked for
  a file name until it meets the
  requirement.
</p>

<pre>
C:\&gt;java filePrompt
input file: glarch
&gt;&gt;&gt;file name must end with .dat&lt;&lt;&lt;
input file: my file.dat
&gt;&gt;&gt;file name must not contain spaces&lt;&lt;&lt;
input file:  .dat
&gt;&gt;&gt;file name missing&lt;&lt;&lt;
input file: myData.dat
OK

C:\&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Use methods of the String class to
manipulate the user's input.
Another approach is the use the
class <code>StringTokenizer</code>,
  a subject of a future chapter.

<h2>Exercise 2 --- Improved Square Root Program</h2>

<p>
Improve the first version of the square root program of the chapter by
repeatedly prompting the user until the number that
is entered is positive.
</p>

<p>
Do this by inserting a nested 
<code>do/while</code> 
inside the
loop body of the
<code>do/while</code> 
that asks if the user wishes to continue.
</p>

<p>
Improve program 
so that the user must respond exactly with
"yes" or "no".
</p>

<pre>
C:\&gt;java squareRoot
Enter a number--&gt; -3
&gt;&gt;&gt;number must be positive&lt;&lt;&lt;
Enter a number--&gt; 3
Square root of 3.0 is 1.7320508075688772
Do you wish to continue (yes or no)? na
&gt;&gt;&gt;Please respond with (yes or no)&lt;&lt;&lt;
Do you wish to continue (yes or no)? no
Bye
C:\&gt;
</pre>

<p>
In this program the main purpose,
  computing and printing the square root,
    is easily done in a few statements.
However, the user interaction calls for some
fairly complicated logic.
This imbalance is typical of user friendly programs.
