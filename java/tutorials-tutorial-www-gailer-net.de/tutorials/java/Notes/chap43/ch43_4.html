<!-- ANSWER AREA -->

<div class="answer">
<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>

<pre class="code">
int a = 7, b = 21;
System.out.println( "The min is: " + (a &lt; b <big><b>?</b></big> a <big><b>:</b></big> b ) );
</pre>

<h1>More Complicated Expressions</h1>
<p>
Here is a slightly more interesting example:
</p>

<blockquote>
A program computes the average grade each student in a class.
Students whose average grade is below 60 are given a bonus
of 5 points.
All other students are given a bonus of just 3 points.
</blockquote>

<p>
Here is the program fragment that does this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
... average grade is computed here ...

average += (average &lt; 60 ) <big><b>?</b></big> 5 <big><b>:</b></big> 3 ;
</pre>

<p>
The sub-expressions 
that make up a conditional expression
can be
as complicated as you want.
Now say that student grades below 60 are to be increased by 10 percent and that
other grades are to be increased by 5 percent.
Here is the program fragment that does this:

<pre class="code">
... average grade is computed here ...

average += (average &lt; 60 )<big><b>?</b></big> average*0.10 <big><b>:</b></big> average*0.05;
</pre>

<p>
This is probably about as complicated as you want to get with the conditional operator.
If you need to do
something more complicated than this,
do it with <code>if-else</code> statements.
