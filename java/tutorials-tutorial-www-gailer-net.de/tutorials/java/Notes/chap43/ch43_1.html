<h1> CHAPTER 43 &#8212; More Ways to Make Decisions</h1>
<p>
Nested
<code>if</code> and <code>else</code> 
statements can be used to choose
between several options.
But, sometimes nested statements
are inconvenient.
This chapter discusses 
other ways to choose between
several options.
</p>

<h4>Chapter Topics:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The conditional operator, <big><b>?</b></big>.</li>
<li>The <code>switch</code> statement.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Neither of these statements
does anything that can't be done 
with <code>if</code>s and <code>else</code>s. 
But they are useful enough to know about,
and you will need to know them to use 
programs written by other programmers.
</p>

<p>
Neither of these statements are
part of the AP Computer Science
test given to high school students
in the US.
For them, 
this entire chapter
may be skipped.
These statements are not used
in the chapters that follow.
