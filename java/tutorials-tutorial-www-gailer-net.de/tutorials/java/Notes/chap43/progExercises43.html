<h2>Exercise 1 --- Character Counter</h2>

<p>
Write a program that determines the number of
consonants, vowels, punctuation characters, and spaces
in an input line.
</p>

<p>
Read in the line into a String (in the usual way).
Now
use the <code>charAt()</code> method in a loop
to access the characters
one by one.
</p>

<p>
Use a <code>switch</code> statement to increment
the appropriate variables based on the current character.
After processing the line, print out the results.

<h2>Exercise 2 --- Character Counter with File Input</h2>

<p>
One exercise one is working, modify it so that it reads in
lines from a file, one by one.
Use input redirection as explained in Chapter 22.
Each line is processed using the logic of exercise one
so that after the file is processed you have the
count of consonants, vowels, punctuation characters, and spaces
for the entire file.
</p>

<p>
After processing the file, print out the raw counts and also
the percentages of each category in the file.
