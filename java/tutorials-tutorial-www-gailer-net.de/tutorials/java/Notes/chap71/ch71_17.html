<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The static view, where a math-like definition is re-written in Java.</li>
<li>The dynamic view, where you think about activations and their parameters.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Two Views of Recursion</h1>

<A NAME="recursion, two views"></A>
<p>
You need to be able to use both views.
Sometimes when you are working on a problem you need to
switch between these two views.
You might write the code using the static viewpoint,
then test and debug the code using the dynamic viewpoint.
</p>


<p>
Let us practice this. Here is the math-like definition of <code>Triangle</code>:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Triangle( 1 ) = 1</li>
<li>Triangle( N ) = N + Triangle( N-1 )
</ol>

<p>
And here is another version of the Java method <code>Triangle()</code>:
</p>

<pre>
int Triangle( int N )
{
    return N + Triangle( N-1 );
}
</pre>

<p>
Say that you try to run this program..... but it never prints out a result.
