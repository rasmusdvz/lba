<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
Two bytes. For ease in doing IO, booleans are represented using
one byte (look at the documentation).

<h1>High Bytes and Low Bytes</h1>

<A NAME="bytes, ordering"></A>
<p>
Java documentation sometimes
uses the terms "low byte" and "high byte".
These  are used when a data type uses
more than one byte.
The <em>low byte</em> is the byte that
holds the 
least significant part of an integer.
If you think in terms of writing a bit pattern
on paper, the low byte is the
rightmost eight bits.
A <code>short</code> holds a 16-bit pattern
such as:
</p>

<pre>
01001010 00001111
</pre>

<p>
The low order byte is <code>00001111</code>.
(The space between the groups is there for readability).
For integer types,
the low order byte holds the part of the number that
consists of powers of two from 0 to 7.
An integer value from 0 to 255 will fit into just the
low byte.
For example, here is the bit pattern for an <code>int</code>
that holds the value 98:
</p>

<pre>
00000000 00000000 00000000 01100010
</pre>

<p>
If this <code>int</code> is written out with
<code>writeInt()</code>, the
bytes are written from high byte to low byte
(or from left to right in the above pattern).
</p>

<p>
For the most part you don't need to think about this
unless you are doing serious systems programming.
A course in assembly language or computer architecture
will say much more about bit patterns.
