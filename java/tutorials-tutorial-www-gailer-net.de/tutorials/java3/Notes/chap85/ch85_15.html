<h1>Same as Before</h1>

<p>
A dump of the new file is indistinguishable from that of the previous file.
A program that reads data from this file must be written with the
knowledge of how the file was written.
(Of course, since I know how it was written the brackets under
the bytes show the intended groupings).

Here is an excerpt from the <code>DataOutputStream</code>
<a href="ch85_10.html#DataOutputStream, documentation" target="_blank" >
 documentation.</a>
</p>

<pre class="code">
public void writeBytes(String s) throws IOException
    Writes the low eight bits of each character in the string.
</pre> 

<p>
This <u>does not</u> write the String object to the stream,
but writes bytes based on the characters held in the String.
A String object (like all objects) is a discrete entity
with its own data, methods, and internal organization.
The <code>writeBytes()</code> just writes out the characters.
If the characters in a String are from the usual Western
alphabet, the <code>writeBytes()</code> method writes 
normal 8-bit ASCII.
