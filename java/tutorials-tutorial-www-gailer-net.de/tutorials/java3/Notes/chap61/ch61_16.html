<h1>Size of the Frame</h1>
<A NAME="frame size"></A>
<p>
The layout manager for this GUI is <code>FlowLayout</code>,
which means that the components are placed in the Frame left to right
in rows starting at the top.
As many components as can fit  go into the first row,
even if this means separating a label from its button:
</p>

<center>
<img src="fatAppWide.gif"/>
</center>

<p>
To get the GUI to look right, the width and height have to be set correctly:
</p>


<pre>
fatApp.setSize( 280, 200 );     
</pre>

<p>
This is a matter of trial-and-error.
There are better ways to do this which use 
additional features of Swing.
Another useful thing to do is to give the entire frame a title.
This is done with: 
</p>


<pre>
setTitle( String title )
</pre>

<p>
Now the top bar of the frame (the one that contains the "close button") 
has a title.
