<h1><code><b>JPanel</b></code></h1>

<A NAME="JPanel"></A>
<p>
The way to layout components in a GUI is:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Add individual components to one or more <b>panel</b>s</li>
<li>Add the panels to the content pane of the frame.</li>
</ol>

<p>
A <code><b>JPanel</b></code> is a container
that is used to group components.
Components added to a panel become inseparable.
Graphically a panel corresponds to a rectangular
section of the screen.
Each panel has its own layout manager
that lays out the components inside the panel.
The default layout manager of <code><b>JPanel</b></code> is
flow layout, which is often ideal.
But you may add whichever layout manager is most appropriate.
</p>

<p>
Now the panels are added to a frame.
The <em>content pane's</em> layout manager arranges the panels
as if each one were a single component.
Panels do  not have visible edges.
