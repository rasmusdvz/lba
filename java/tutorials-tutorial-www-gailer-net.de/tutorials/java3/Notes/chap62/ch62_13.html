<p>
The left and right panels are put in yet
another panel (called <code>dataPan</code> in the program.
The buttons are put in <code>butPan</code>
Now <code>dataPan</code> and <code>butPan</code> are
added to the content pane using <code>BoxLayout</code>
and vertical alignment.
The picture shows how this works.
</p>

<p>
This idea of nesting panels is a powerful one.
It may look complicated and tedious, 
but it is much less so than laying out a design
on graph paper and absolutely specifying the size and
location of all the components.
Such a design has no flexibility.
What happens if you want to add or delete a component?
Everything must change.
With Java's layout managers everything is dynamically adjusted.
