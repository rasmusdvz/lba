<h1>IO Streams</h1>

<A NAME="IO streams"></A>

<p>
The core Java language does not have any IO methods.
For a program to do IO, it must <code>import</code> an IO
package.
These notes (and most programs) use the package <code>java.io</code>.
</p>

<p>
Data for a program may come from several 
sources.
Data created by a program
may be sent to several destinations.
The connection between a program and a data source
or destination is called a <b>stream</b>.
An <u>input stream</u>  handles data
flowing <u>into</u> a program.
An <u>output stream</u> handles data 
flowing <u>out of</u> a program.

<p>
In the picture, each "O" is a piece of data.
The data are streaming from the source into the program,
and streaming from the program to the destination.
