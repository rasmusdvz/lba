<h1>Readers and Writers</h1>
<p>
Readers and Writers deal with character streams.
These are abstract classes.
A program must use classes derived from them.
For example, a <code>BufferedReader</code> is a <code>Reader</code>
(many of our example programs have used <code>BufferedReader</code>).

<A NAME="UTF"></A>
<p>
Character streams are optimized for handling character data.
They also translate between the <b>internal</b> format used by Java
programs and an <b>external</b> format used for text files.
Inside a Java program character data is represented with
the 16-bit <code>char</code> data type.
The characters of a <code>String</code> use the same 16-bit code.
On a disk file, characters are represented in a format called UTF.
This format uses one, two, or three bytes per character and is
intended to be a universal format&#8212;one format for all
text files in any language anywhere in the world.
</p>

<p>
UTF stands for "<u>U</u>niversal character set <u>T</u>ransformation <u>F</u>ormat".
(Most people decide to forget that and call it "Universal Text Format").
Usually a UTF text file is identical to an ASCII text file.
ASCII is the standard that 
most computers have used up until now.
A file created with <em>NotePad</em> is an ASCII text file. 
However, a UTF text file can include non-ASCII characters 
such as Cyrillic, Greek, and Asian characters.
By reading and writing UTF files, Java programs can process
text from any of the World's languages.
