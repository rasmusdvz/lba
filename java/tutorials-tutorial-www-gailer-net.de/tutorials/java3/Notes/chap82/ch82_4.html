<!-- ANSWER AREA -->


<div class="answer">
<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
Yes.
For example, a text editor typically does output to both the monitor and to
a disk file.
Its input comes from both a disk file and the keyboard.

<h1>Processing Streams</h1>

<A NAME="buffer"></A>
<A NAME="stream, processing"></A>

<p>
A <b>processing</b> stream operates on the data supplied by another stream.
Often a processing stream acts as a buffer for
the data coming from another stream.
A <b>buffer</b> is a block of main memory used as a work area.
For example, disk file data usually is delivered by the operating system
in blocks of 512 bytes at a time.
Usually this data is buffered and delivered to a program in more suitable
sizes.
</p>

<p>
You have seen this before.
In the following,
the keyboard sends data to the 
<b>InputStream</b> <code>System.in</code> which is connected to a
<b>InputStreamReader</b> stream
which is connected to a <b>BufferedReader</b> stream.
<code>System.in</code> is a stream object that the Java system
automatically creates when your program starts running.
</p>

<pre class="code">
BufferedReader stdin = 
    new BufferedReader( new  InputStreamReader( System.in ) );
</pre>

</center>

<p>
The data is transformed along the way.
The raw bytes from the keyboard are grouped
together into a String object that the program
reads using <code>stdin.readLine()</code>.
</p>

<p>
This may seem like an unnecessary complication.
But <code>java.io</code> gives you a collection of
parts that can be assembled to do nearly any IO task
you need.

Might several connected streams be used for output?
