<!-- ANSWER AREA -->


<div class="answer">
<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>


<pre>
drawOval( 100-50, 300-50, 2*50, 2*50 )
</pre>


<p>
Of course the method would work if you did the arithmetic and put
the results in the method call, but why bother?

<h1>Drawing Rectangles</h1>
<A NAME="drawRect()"></A>
<p>
To draw a rectangle,
use the <code>drawRect()</code> method of the Graphics object.
This method looks like:
</p>


<pre>
drawRect(int  x, int  y, int  width, int  height)
</pre>


<p>
It draws the outline of a rectangle using the current pen color.
The left and right edges of the rectangle are at x and x + width respectively.
The top and bottom edges of the rectangle are at y and y + heigth respectively.
</p>

<p>
Of course, if you want a square you would use this method also.
Here is an applet that surrounds the entire drawing area with a
rectangle,
then puts another rectangle in the center.
</p>

<pre class="program">
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.*;

// assume that the drawing area is 150 by 150
public class SquareAndRectangle extends Applet
{
  final int areaSide = 150 ;
  final int width = 100, height = 50;

  public void paint ( Graphics gr )
  {
    setBackground( Color.green );
    gr.setColor( Color.blue );

    // outline the drawing area
    gr.drawRect( 0, 0, areaSide-1, areaSide-1 );

    // draw interiour rectange.
    gr.drawRect( areaSide/2 - width/2 ,
        areaSide/2 - height/2, width, height );
   }
}
</pre>

<p>
Here is what it draws on your screen:
</p>

<center>
<applet code="SquareAndRectangle.class"  width="150" height="150">
Not all browsers can run applets.  If you see this, yours can not.
</applet>
</center>

<p>
When drawing the outer square, one was subtracted from its
width and height so that the edges would be inside the drawing area.
