<h2>Exercise 1: Immutable Box </h2>
<p>
Implement a class <em>Box</em> similar to the class in
a previous review exercise.
But the new implementation of <em>Box</em> will have better
encapsulation.
Here is the documentation for  <em>Box</em>:
<blockquote>
<b>class Box</b>
<p>
A class that implements a cardboard box.
</p>
<p>
<b>Constructors</b>
</p>
<p>
Box ( double width, double height, double length )
</p>
<p>
Box ( double side )
</p>
<p>
<b>Methods</b>
</p>
<p>
double volume()
</p>
double area()
<p>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Look at the previous programming exercise 
for more discussion and for code which
easily can be modified for this and the next two exercises.
</p>
<p>
In the current implementation of <em>Box</em> make all the
instance variables <em>private</em>.
This means that only methods of a <em>Box</em> object can
see that object's data.
The object will be <em>immutable</em>
if there are no access methods that make changes to this
data.
 An <em>immutable</em> object is one whose data does not
change.
You may remember that <em>String</em> objects are immutable---once
the characters of the <em>String</em> are set with a constructor
they never change (although they can be used to create other <em>String</em> objects.)
There are many advantages to using immutable objects,
especially when programming with threads (which is how nearly all big programs
are written.)
</p>
Give <em>public</em> access to the methods of <em>Box</em>.
<p>
</p>

<p>
Test your <em>Box</em> class with several versions of this program:

<blockquote><pre>
import Box;
class BoxTester
{

  public static void main ( String[] args )
  {
     Box box = new  Box( 2.5, 5.0, 6.0 ) ;

     System.out.println( "Area: "  + box.area() + " volume: " + box. volume() );

     System.out.println( "length: " + box.length + " height: " + box. height +
                         "width:  " + box.width )  ;

  }
}
</blockquote></pre>
(The above program will not compile, which is what you want.  
Reflect on why it does not compile and fix it so that it does.)

<h2>Exercise 2: Private Methods for <em>Box</em> </h2>
<p>
The implementation of <em>area()</em> given in the previous review exercise is
probably reasonable for the <em>Box</em> class.
But to practice <em>private</em> methods write it like this:
<blockquote><pre>
  double area()
  {
    return 2 * faceArea() + 2 * topArea() + 2 * sideArea() ;              
  }
</blockquote></pre>
In this,
<em>faceArea()</em>,
<em>topArea() </em>, and
<em>sideArea()</em>
are <em>private</em> methods that calculate the area of
the front face, the top and the side of the box.
You will have to add them to your class.
Often private methods are "helping" methods that the public methods use,
but are not to be used outside the class.
Test your program with several versions of the following:
<blockquote><pre>
import Box;
class BoxTester
{

  public static void main ( String[] args )
  {
     Box box = new  Box( 2.5, 5.0, 6.0 ) ;

     System.out.println( "Area: "  + box.area() + " volume: " + box. volume() );
     System.out.println( "topArea: "  + box.topArea() );

  }
}
</blockquote></pre>
(The above program will not compile, as expected.)

<h2>Exercise 3: Box Constructor and Access Methods</h2>
<p>
Add a new constructor to the <em>Box</em> class:
<blockquote><pre>
Box( Box oldBox )
</blockquote></pre>
This constructor creates a new <em>Box</em> object with identical dimensions as the
old <em>Box</em> object.
Of course, the old object is not changed. 
</p>
Now add some <em>access methods</em>.
An <em>access method</em> is a method that can be used to access the
private variables (and other variables) of an object:
<blockquote><pre>
public double length()
public double height()
public double width()
</blockquote></pre>
Each of these methods merely returns the value of one instance variable.
Since the object is immutable,
there will be no access methods that alter the instance variables.
Test you program with modifications of the previous testing class.
<p>

<h2>Exercise 4: Bigger Boxes </h2>
<p>
It would be nice to create a box that is bigger than a given box.
Write this method:
<blockquote><pre>
public Box biggerBox( Box oldBox )
</blockquote></pre>
This is a <em>public</em> method that returns (evalutes to) a
reference to a new <em>Box</em>.
The new <em>Box</em> will be 25% larger in each dimension that
the old box.
The method will have to use a constructor inside of it to create
the new box:
<blockquote><pre>
public Box biggerBox( Box oldBox )
{

  return Box( 1.25*oldBox.width(), ...... )
}
</blockquote></pre>
</p>
<p>
Now write a method that returns a box that is 25% <em>smaller</em> in
every dimension than a given box.
As usual, write a testing program that exercises your class.

<h2>Exercise 5: Nesting Boxes </h2>
<p>
Write a method that evaluates to <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>
depending on whether one box completely fits inside another:
<blockquote><pre>
public boolean nests( Box outsideBox, Box insideBox )
</blockquote></pre>
This is potentially a difficult method, since the
inside box may fit or not fit depending on how it
is rotated.
To simplify the method,
write it so that it returns <em>true</em> if the
two boxes nest without considering rotations
(so height is compared to height, length compared to length,
and so on.)

<h2>What to turn in:</h2>
<p>
If this were an assignment in a regular class you might be asked to turn in
the following:
<OL>
<LI>Neatly written documentation of the final version of your class.
    <UL>
    <LI>Write the documentation in the style given at the top of this page,
        similar in style to most Java class documentation.
    <LI>Short comments describe each method and constructor.
    <LI>Private instance variables and private methods are not mentioned in
        this documentation.  The documentation is supposed to describe the
        <em>interface</em> to users of the class.
    </UL>
<LI>The source code for the final implementation of the class.
    <UL>
    <LI>Comments at the top of the souce describe what it is, who wrote it,
        when it was written, and what is debugging status is.
    <LI>Short comments are used to explain each method and some statements.
    <LI>Indenting and blank lines must be used to show the structure and
        organization of the class.
    </UL>
<LI>Source code and output for several small programs that test the various
    features of the class.
</OL>
<p>
Often, putting together the material to turn in is a substantial part of the
work.
This is good practice for the "real world."
