<div class="answer">
<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
Just one:
</p>

<pre>
public void paint ( Graphics gr )
</pre>

<p>
(However, the class inherits many more methods
from class <code>Applet</code>).

<h1>Extending the Applet Class</h1>
<p>
The definition of <code>Applet</code>
provides a framework
for building an applet.
By itself, the class <code>Applet</code> 
does little that is visible in
the Web browser.
(It does a great many things behind the scenes, however.)
</p>

<A NAME="Applet, extending"></A>
<p>
To build upon this framework, you 
<em>import</em> 
<code>java.applet.Applet</code>
and
<em>extend</em>
the Applet class:
</p>

<pre class="program">
<span class="red">import java.applet.Applet;</span>
import java.awt.*;

public class AEHousman <span class="red">extends Applet</span>
{
  public void paint ( Graphics gr )
  { 
    setBackground( Color.pink );
    gr.drawString("Loveliest of trees, the cherry now", 25, 30);
    gr.drawString("Is hung with bloom along the bough,", 25, 50);
    gr.drawString("And stands about the woodland ride", 25, 70 );
    gr.drawString("Wearing white for Eastertide." ,25, 90);
    gr.drawString("--- A. E. Housman" ,50, 130);
   }
}
</pre>


<p>
When you extend a class, you are making a new class by 
building upon a base class.
This example defines a new class called <code>AEHousman</code>.
The new class has everything in it that the class <code>Applet</code> has.
(This is called <em>inheritance</em>.
Inheritance is discussed at greater length in chapter 50.)
</p>

<p>
The class <code>Applet</code> has a <code>paint()</code> method, 
but that method does little.
Objects of class 
<code>AEHousman</code> 
have their own 
<code>paint()</code> 
method because the definition in <code>AEHousman.java</code>
overrides the one in <code>Applet</code>.
</p>

<p>
The Web browser calls the <code>paint()</code> method when it needs to "paint"
the section of the monitor screen devoted to an applet.
Each applet that you write 
has its own <code>paint()</code> method.
</p>

<h3> QUESTION 3:</h3>
<a href="ch36_4.html">
<img src="../nextBut.gif" hspace="5" align="right" border="0"/></a>
<p>
Pretend that the Web browser has just called the <code>paint()</code> method.
The first statement in the method is:
</p>

<pre>
setBackground( Color.pink );
</pre>

<p>
What do you suppose that this does?
