<!-- ANSWER AREA -->
<p>
Do you expect that applets have a <code>main</code> method?
</p>

<div class="answer">
<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
No. 
The methods of an applet are called by another program,
  not by its own <code>main</code> method.

<h1>An Example Applet</h1>
<A NAME="applet"></A>
<p>
An applet is an object that is used  by another program,
typically a Web browser.
The Web browser is the application program and (at least conceptually)
holds the <code>main()</code> method.
The applet part of a Web page
provides services (methods) to the browser when the browser asks for them.
</p>

<p>
An applet object has many 
instance variables and methods.
Most of this is in the definition of <code>Applet</code>.
To access these definitions,
your program should import <code>java.applet.Applet</code>
and <code>java.awt.*</code>.
Here is the code for a small applet.
The name of the class is <code>AEHousman</code>
and the name of the source file is <code>AEHousman.java.</code>
</p>

<pre class="program">
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.*;

public class AEHousman extends Applet
{
  public void paint ( Graphics gr )
  { 
    setBackground( Color.pink );
    gr.drawString("Loveliest of trees, the cherry now", 25, 30);
    gr.drawString("Is hung with bloom along the bough,", 25, 50);
    gr.drawString("And stands about the woodland ride", 25, 70 );
    gr.drawString("Wearing white for Eastertide." ,25, 90);
    gr.drawString("--- A. E. Housman" ,50, 130);
   }
}
</pre>

<p>
Compile the applet just like an application
using <code>javac AEHousman.java</code>.
This produces a bytecode file called <code>AEHousman.class</code>.
Now it can be used in a Web page.
Here is what this applet does:
</p>

<center>
<applet code="AEHousman.class" width="300" height="150">
Not all browsers can run applets.  If you see this, yours can not.
You should be able to continue reading these lessons, however.
</applet>
</center>


<p>
This applet is explained in the next several pages.

<a href="ch36_3.html">
<img src="../nextBut.gif" hspace="5" align="right" border="0"/></a>
<p>
Look at the code for the class <code>AEHousman</code>.
How many methods does it define?
