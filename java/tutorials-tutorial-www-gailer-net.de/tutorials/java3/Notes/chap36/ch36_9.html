<h1>HTML</h1>
<A NAME="html"></A>
<p>
Files that have the file extension "html" are expected to contain
a description of a Web page using a notation called
<em>hypertext markup language</em>.
This language describes the page layout in functional roles, 
and leaves the exact layout up to the browser.
For example the following part of an "html" file says that the
characters between the &lt;p&gt; and the &lt;/p&gt; are to
be formatted as a paragraph,
but exactly how the paragraph is laid out is up to the browser.
</p>

<pre>
&lt;p&gt;
It began one day in
summer about thirty years ago,
and it happened to four children.
Jane was the oldest 
and Mark was the only boy, 
and between them they ran everything.
&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Here is what your current Web browser does for that paragraph
(you may wish to change the font size of your browser and watch
the formatting change):

<A NAME="tags, html"></A>
<p>
The &lt;p&gt; and the &lt;/p&gt; are exampls of HTML <b>tags</b> that are
used describe the layout of a page.
Often tags come in matched pairs that are used to show the start
and end of something.
If tag like &lt;<em>something</em>&gt; has a matching tag, 
the matching tag
will look like  &lt;<em>/something</em>&gt; .
The "markup" of the phrase <em>hypertext markup language</em>
means that you describe the functional role of each part of the file,
but the browser decides how to implement that role.
For example, the role of the text between &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt;
is that of a paragraph.
Here is another example:
</p>

<blockquote>
&lt;h3&gt;This is a level 3 heading&lt;/h3&gt;
</blockquote>

<p>
This
describes a heading (three levels down from the most important heading.)
Exactly what is done to make the text a heading is up to the browser.
Your browser does this:
</p>

<h3>This is a level 3 heading</h3>

<p>
An HTML file can be created with an ordinary text editor 
(such as NotePad) 
since it  contains nothing but ASCII characters.
There are no hidden display codes or other unprintable characters such
as word processors usually produce.
(However, an HTML file can ask for the Web page to include other files that
are not ASCII, such as images and applets.)
Since an HTML file is pure ASCII,
it is very portable and
can be used by Web browsers on any kind of computer.

Insert some HTML into the

top of the page that says: 
"Here is an Exciting Applet". 
After the heading, write a paragraph describing the size of the applets
