Here is a review of how recursion works
with <code>Triangle()</code>.
</p>

<pre>
int Triangle( int N )
{
  if ( N == 1 )
    return 1;
  else
    return N + Triangle( N-1 );
}
</pre>

<p>
Click on 
the diagram shows the steps of the computation.
Each <u>activation</u> of the method is represented
by a circle.
Each activation has its own parameter and returns
a value to its caller.
</p>

<p>
An activation may need to wait for a returned value
before it can continue with a computation.
In the diagram this is represented by a circle on the
chain that has not returned a value.
The circle is labeled with the statement that is
waiting for a result.
</p>

<p>
The bottom circle represents the <u>base case</u>
which immediately returns a value to its caller.
</p>

<p>
When the base case is reached,
values start returning to callers,
and activations start completing their work.
</p>

<p>
When an activation is finished with its work,
its circle is removed from the chain.
</p>

<p>
The final picture (which shows nothing) represents
the case where the first activation of <code>Triangle()</code>
has completed the computation and returned a value to its
caller.
