<h1>Formula for Triangle</h1>

<!--INDEX></INDEX-->
<p>
<code>Triangle</code> is so easy that you don't need to use either
iteration or recursion for it.
You might recognize <code>Triangle(N)</code> as the sum of the series
</p>

<pre>
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (N-1) + N = (N(N+1)) / 2
</pre>

<p>
For example
</p>

<pre>
1 + 2 + 3 + 4  = (4(5)) / 2 = 10
</pre>

<p>
Of course a Java  method that implements this formula is simple.
And that is how you would do it in a practical situation.
But the goal of this chapter was to show recursion with Java and
and triangle numbers work well for that.
