This keeps on going.  Each round divides the problem into  an integer
and a problem that is smaller by one.
Eventually you reach the end:
</p>

<pre>
number of pins in 12 rows = 12 + number of pins in 11 rows
number of pins in 11 rows = 11 + number of pins in 10 rows

                        . . .

number of pins in  3 rows =  3 + number of pins in 2 rows
number of pins in  2 rows =  2 + <b>number of pins in 1 row</b>
                          =  2 + <b>1</b>
</pre>

<p>
The <em>number of pins in 1 row</em> is called a <b>base case</b>.
A <em>base case</em> is a problem that can solved immediately.
In this example, the number of pins in 1 row is 1.
