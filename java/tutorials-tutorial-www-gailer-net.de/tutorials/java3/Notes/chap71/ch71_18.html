<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
From a <b>static</b> viewpoint, what is wrong?
</p>

<blockquote>
The base case <code>Triangle(1) = 1</code> was left out of the Java code.
</blockquote>

<p>
From a <b>dynamic</b> viewpoint, what is wrong?
</p>

<blockquote>
The method always calls for another activation 
regardless of the value of the parameter,
so the chain of
activation keeps growing until system resources run out.

<h1>Computational Advantages of Iteration and Recursion</h1>

<A NAME="Advantages of recursion and iteration"></A>
<p>
Recursion is useful because sometimes a problem is naturally recursive.
Then all you need to do is match it with Java code.
But recursion does not add any fundamental power to Java.

<blockquote>
Any method that is written using recursion can be written using iteration.
Any method that is written using iteration can be written using recursion.

<p>
A computer programming language needs to include only one of iteration or
recursion to be as powerful as any other programming language.
Some languages (such as early FORTRAN) have only iteration.
Other languages (such as early LISP) have only recursion.
Most modern languages have both, because both are convenient.
