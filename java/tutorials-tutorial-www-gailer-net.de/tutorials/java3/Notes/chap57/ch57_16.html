<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
Yes&#8212;this might look odd, but it works.
Since <code>main()</code> is static, the Java system has only
one copy of it at a time.
The new <code>myFrame</code> object will not have another copy of <code>main()</code>.

<p>
It helps to look at the steps in order:
</p>

<ol>
<li>The static <code>main()</code> method starts running.
    <ul><li>Since it is static, <code>main()</code> is part of the bytecodes that the
            compiler produced. It exists and is available to run when you
            start the program.</li></ul></li><br>
<li>The <code>main()</code> method asks for a <code>myFrame</code> object to be created
    and puts a reference to it in a variable.
    <ul><li>Since <code>main()</code> is static, this will <u>not</u>
            make a second copy of <code>main()</code></li></ul></li>
</ol>


<p>
The picture of this program is nearly the same as for the previous version,
except now the "static part" belongs to the <em>myFrame</em> class.
</p>

<p>
Compare this with the picture for the 
<a href="ch57_10.html#GUI, picture" target="_blank" >
 previous version </a>
of the program
to see how things fit together.
The two programs behave in exactly the same way.
Which way you organize your program is up to you.
A big program with many frames will probably use
the first method; a small program will probably use
the second method.
