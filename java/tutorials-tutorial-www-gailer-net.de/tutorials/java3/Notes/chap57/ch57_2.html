<h1>Java GUI Programming</h1>

<p>
To write a GUI application, write code
for each of these three
parts (while keeping the big picture in mind.)
There are several ways to organize the code.
If you keep the big picture in mind, the details
about the various options will fall into perspective.
</p>

<p>
So far our  examples have done only the first task.
There were no event listeners nor application code.
Our programs defined a <code>myFrame</code> class,
constructed it, 
and displayed it on the monitor.
Usually the first task would  add  many GUI
components (such as buttons and text fields) to the frame.
We will do this later on.
