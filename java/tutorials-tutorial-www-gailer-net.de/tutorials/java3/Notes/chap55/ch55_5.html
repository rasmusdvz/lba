<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
I asked for  button objects that do what I want.  
Somebody else did all the real work.
The buttons are <b>components</b> that can be
added with minimum effort.
</p>

<p>
This is similar to going to a hardware store to
get components for your home improvement project.
Most of the parts you need already exist.
You just assemble them.

<p>
In Java programming, you can get the GUI components you
want merely by asking for them.
Most of the work has already been done and is contained in the
Swing package.
Swing contains windows, frames, buttons,
menus and other components.
</p>

<p>
A user interacts with a GUI application by causing events.
The application must respond to events
in the order they arrive.
The picture shows this.
Each time the user interacts with a component, 
an event is
sent to the application.
Different events are sent
to different parts of the application.
The application has to work correctly no matter what the user does.
(Usually an application ignores  events that are not relevant to its purpose.)

<p>
Move the mouse pointer over the diagram.
This is a <em>mouseOver</em> event.
Is this event ignored?
</p>

<p>
Now move the mouse over the "next" button.
Is this event ignored?
