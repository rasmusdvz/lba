<p>
A GUI program consists of a collection of graphical components that
are all placed inside one or more windows.
You think of most components as being <em>contained</em> by a particular window.
A <b>container</b> is an
object that can hold other GUI components.
Visually, a container is an area of the screen and
the objects it contains are shown as smaller areas within it.
</p>

<p>
In Java terminology, a window 
(such as the browser window you are looking at)
is a container.
The buttons, sliders, icons and other GUI components are
contained (by the container).
