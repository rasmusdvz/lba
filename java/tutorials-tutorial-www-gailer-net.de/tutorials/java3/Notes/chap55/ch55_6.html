<div class="answer">
<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
Yes, for the figure the <em>mouseOver</em> event is ignored.
</p>

<p>
No, for the button the <em>mouseOver</em> event changes the  mouse
pointer from an arrow to a hand.
(Some browsers don't do this.)

<h1>Three Parts of a GUI Program</h1>
<A NAME="GUI program, three tasks"></A>

<p>
A GUI program consists of three types of software:
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Graphical Components</b> that make up the Graphical User Interface.</li>
<li><b>Listener methods</b> that receive the events and respond to them.</li>
<li><b>Application methods</b>  that do  useful work for the user.</li>
</ol>

<p>
You get  graphical components by constructing Swing objects.
Listener methods and application methods are Java methods that you
write.
You have already written application methods:
they are just ordinary Java methods that perform useful computations.
</p>

<p>
Your web browser has components 
(such as the "back" and "forward" buttons),
listener methods that receive events 
(such as a click on the "back" button)
and application methods that do useful things
(such as moving back one page.)
</p>

<p>
To write a GUI application, 
keep the three types software
separated
(while keeping the big picture in mind.)
In a big software project  an entire 
team of programmers is assigned to each of the tasks.

<p>
Consider a radio and its user interface.  Match each
part of the radio with its analogous part in a GUI application.
