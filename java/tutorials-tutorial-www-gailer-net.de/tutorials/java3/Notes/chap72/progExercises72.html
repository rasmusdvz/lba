<h2>Exercise 1</h2>
<p>
A <b>prime number</b> is an integer that cannot be divided by any
integer other than one and itself.
For example, 7 is prime because its only divisors are 1 and 7.
The integer 8 is not prime because its divisors are 1, 2, 4, and 8.
</p>

<p>
Another way to define prime is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
prime(N)    = prime(N, N-1)

prime(N, 1) = true

prime(N, D) = if D divides N, false
              else prime(N, D-1)           
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
For example,
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
prime(4)   = prime(4,3)
prime(4,3) = prime(4,2)
prime(4,2) = false
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Another example,
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
prime(7)   = prime(7,6)
prime(7,6) = prime(7,5)
prime(7,5) = prime(7,4)
prime(7,4) = prime(7,3)
prime(7,3) = prime(7,2)
prime(7,1) = true
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Translate the math-like definition of prime into two Java methods that
return <code>boolean</code>.
Use the <b><code>%</code></b> operator to test divisibility.
Put your method into a class, write a testing class, and test your
program.
(Look at <code>FactorialTester.java</code> in this chapter.)
</p>

<p>
If you run your program for integers larger than about 12,000 (on a Windows system)
you will run out of memory.
Your program will stop running and report a <em>StackOverflowError</em>.
This is because each activation in the activation chain requires some memory,
and 12,000 activations uses up all the memory that has been reserved for this use.

<h2>Exercise 2</h2>
<p>
Assume that female rabbits live for only 4 months.
Modify the math-like definition of the Fibonacci series to
account for dying rabbits.
Implement the new series as a Java method.
</p>

<p>
First draw a chart showing the population of rabbits by month.
Then deduce the new rules for the series.
You will have more base cases than in the original series.
