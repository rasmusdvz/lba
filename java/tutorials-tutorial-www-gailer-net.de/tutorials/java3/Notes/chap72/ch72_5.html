<h3>Eine gute Antwort w&auml;re:</h3>
<p>
As it is written, calling <nobr><code>factorial( -1 )</code></nobr>
would grow the activation chain without limit.
The base case (of <code>N == 0</code>) would never be reached.
Eventually the computer system would run out of resources,
and the program would stop running.
</p>

<pre>
int factorial( int N )
{
  if ( N == 0 )
    return 1;
  else
    return N * factorial( N-1 ) ;
}
</pre>

<h1>Defensive Programming</h1>

<A NAME="defensive programming"></A>
<p>
<b>Defensive programming</b> is when the programmer anticipates
problems and writes code to deal with them.
To avoid the disaster a negative parameter would cause,
sometimes <code>factorial()</code> is written like this:
</p>

<pre>
int factorial( int N )
{
  if ( N &lt= 0 )
    return 1;
  else
    return N * factorial( N-1 ) ;
}
</pre>

<p>
But, according to the math-like definition, this is not correct.
The value of <nobr><code>factorial( -1 )</code></nobr> is undefined,
not equal to one.
Potentially, returning an incorrect value and continuing on as if nothing is
wrong might cause a greater disaster than stopping the computer system.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the method is written to throw an exception when an illegal argument
is detected.
But this adds complication since now the caller
must deal with a possible exception.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the best solution is to write <nobr><code>factorial()</code></nobr>
so that it follows the math-like definition exactly.
It is the responsibility of the caller to
make sure that the argument is within range.

<p>
Here is another idea: why not have <nobr><code>factorial()</code></nobr> take
the absolute value of its argument to be sure that it is positive?
