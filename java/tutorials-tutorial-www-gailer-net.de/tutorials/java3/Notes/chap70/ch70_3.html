<h1>Slightly Closer to the Goal</h1>

<p>
The instructions: <em>a journey of a 1000 yards begins with a single step</em>
tell how to reduce the size of the problem.
The problem is how to cross the parking lot.  After taking a single step,
  the problem is slightly smaller.
</p>

<p>
Of course, now you reduce the size of the new problem by taking yet another step.
Before long, the problem is so reduced in size that it 
can be solved in one step.
