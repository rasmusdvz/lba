<h1>The Line on Recursion</h1>

<A NAME="line, dividing into parts"></A>
<p>
Recall the two parts of a recursive solution:
</p>

<!-- parts to recursion -->
<ol>
<li>If the problem is easy, solve it immediately.</li>
<li>If the problem can't be solved immediately,
    divide it into smaller problems, then:
    <ul>
    <li>Solve the smaller problems by applying this procedure to each of them.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
In terms of the "divide a line into 16 pieces" problem these are:
</p>

<ol>
<li>If a line is small enough, don't divide it.</li>
<li>Divide the line into two pieces.
    <ul>
    <li>Apply this process to each of the two pieces.</li> 
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
