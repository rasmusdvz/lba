The problem has been solved when you are at the mall entrance.

<h1>Two Parts to Recursion</h1>

<A NAME="recursion, two parts"></A>
<p>
Of course you know how to cross a parking lot.  You would
probably describe the process as "...keep walking until you reach the entrance."
</p>

<p>
Let us describe the solution in more detail:
</p>

<ol>
<li>If you are one step from the mall, take that step and you are done.</li>
<li>If you are further than one step from the mall, divide the distance into two parts:
    <ul>
    <li>a single step, and</li> 
    <li>the remaining distance.</li>
    </ul>
    Now take a step and then cross the remaining distance.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
I've described the solution  in a recursive style.
There are two parts to recursion:
</p>

<!-- parts to recursion -->
<ol>
<li>If the problem is easy, solve it immediately.</li>
<li>If the problem can't be solved immediately,
    divide it into smaller problems, then:
    <ul>
    <li>Solve the smaller problems by applying this procedure to each of them.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
The over-all strategy is to find some easily applied action that
breaks the problem into smaller pieces.  Some of the pieces can
be dealt with immediately; others need to be further broken up.
