<h1>Recursion on the Rocks</h1>

<A NAME="rock, breaking up"></A>
<p>
Here (again) are the two parts to recursion:
</p>

<!-- parts to recursion -->
<ol>
<li>If the problem is easy, solve it immediately.</li>
<li>If the problem can't be solved immediately,
    divide it into smaller problems, then:
    <ul>
    <li>Solve the smaller problems by applying this procedure to each of them.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
Here are how this applies to the rock-destruction problem:
</p>

<ol>
<li>When a piece is small, don't pound it any further.</li>
<li>To destroy a large rock, hit it with a hammer. 
    The rock shatters, leaving small and large pieces.
    <ul>
    <li>Apply this procedure to each of the pieces.</li> 
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
