<!-- ANSWER AREA -->

<div class="answer">
<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>

<pre class="code">
Math.sin( 0.5 ) &gt;= Math.tan( 0.2 ) || 43.259 / 12.073 &gt; 3.5 || ( 100 &gt; 45 )
</pre>

<p>
There are no side-effects here, so it is safe to look at the last part:
</p>

<pre class="code">
( 100 &gt; 45 )
</pre>

<p>
and realize that the entire expression will be <code>true</code>.
Java (working from left to right) might have found a different <code>true</code>,
but in the absence of side-effects that doesn't matter.
The entire expression is <code>true</code>.
</p>
<p>
Math functions, such as <code>Math.sin()</code> and <code>Math.cos()</code>,
do not have side effects.
They are safe to use in boolean expressions.

<h1>Red Miata Sports Car <img src="redMiata.gif"></h1>

<p>
Say that you have not yet given up on buying that $25,000 red Miata sports car.
The sales manager of the car lot will let you buy the car if:
</p>

<ul>
<li>You have at least $25,000 in cash, OR</li>
<li>You have at least $25,000 in credit AND no outstanding debts.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The logic of this situation is slightly complicated. Here are several situations:
</p>

<ul>
<li>You have $30,000 in cash, no credit and massive debts. &nbsp; &nbsp; You get the car.</li>
<li>You have $1,000 in cash,  $50,000 in credit and massive debts. &nbsp; &nbsp; You DON'T get the car.</li>
<li>You have $1,000 in cash,  $10,000 in credit and no debts. &nbsp; &nbsp; You DON'T get the car.</li>
<li>You have $1,000 in cash,  $30,000 in credit and no debts. &nbsp; &nbsp; You get the car.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Notice that it is not enough to merely have a high credit line.
To buy the car on credit you must also be free of debt.
