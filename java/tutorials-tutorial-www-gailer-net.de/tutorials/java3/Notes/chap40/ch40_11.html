<!-- ANSWER AREA -->

<div class="answer">
<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>

<pre class="code">
(4 &lt; 8 ) || (  8 &lt; 0 ) || ( 100 &gt; 45 )
--------
  true
</pre>

<p>
.... evaluation stops with the first <code>true</code> and
the entire expression is  <code>true</code>.

<div class="lesson">
<h1>Cascade of || Operators</h1>
<p>
The <code>||</code> operator also has left to right associativity.
In other words, it works like you expect.
When an expression has several <code>||</code>'s  look
for a <code>true</code> starting from the left and going toward the right.
The first <code>true</code>  stops the evaluation and causes the entire
expression to be <code>true</code>.
If every operand is <code>false</code> then every operand is evaluated and
the entire
expression is <code>false</code>.
</p>

<p>
When there are possible side effects it is important to understand
that evaluation goes from left to right, as explained above.
If there are no side effects (as in the expression used for the question)
it doesn't really matter.
