<div class="answer">
<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>

<pre class="code">
(4 &lt; 8 ) &amp;&amp; (  8 &lt; 0 ) &amp;&amp; ( 100 &gt; 45 )
   (T    &amp;&amp;      F)    &amp;&amp; ( 100 &gt; 45 )
          F            &amp;&amp; ( 100 &gt; 45 )
</pre>

<p>
... evaluation stops with the value <code>false</code> for the entire expression.

<h1>Cascade of &amp;&amp; Operators</h1>
<A NAME="and operator, several per expression"></A>
<p>
When there are more than two &amp;&amp; operators in an expression,
pairs of operands are grouped togther with an &amp;&amp; starting from
the left and going toward the right of the expression.
Such a group works as a single operand for the next &amp;&amp; to the right.
</p>

<p>
Assume that V, W, X, Y, and Z stand for boolean operands.
Then operands are grouped from left to right:
</p>

<pre class="code">
   V &amp;&amp; W  &amp;&amp; X   &amp;&amp; Y  &amp;&amp; X

  (V &amp;&amp; W) &amp;&amp; X   &amp;&amp; Y  &amp;&amp; X

 ((V &amp;&amp; W) &amp;&amp; X ) &amp;&amp; Y  &amp;&amp; X

(((V &amp;&amp; W) &amp;&amp; X ) &amp;&amp; Y) &amp;&amp; X
</pre>

<A NAME="associativity"></A>
<p>
In the last line (above) every &amp;&amp; operator has one operand to its left and one
operand to its right.
The <em>associativity</em> of an operator is how its operands are grouped in
situations like this.
The &amp;&amp; operator has <em>Left to Right</em> Associativity.
Most (but not all) operators work this way.
</p>

<p>
If you are not happy with the above discussion, don't worry about it.
Mostly all you need to know is that an expression with many &amp;&amp;'s  works by looking
for a <code>false</code> starting from the left and going toward the right.
The first <code>false</code> it finds stops evaluation and causes the entire
expression to be <code>false</code>.
If every operand is <code>true</code> then every operand is evaluated and 
the entire
expression is <code>true</code>.
