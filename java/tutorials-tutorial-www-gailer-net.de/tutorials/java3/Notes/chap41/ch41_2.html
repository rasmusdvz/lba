<tr bgcolor="lightblue"><th>type</th><th>description</th></tr>
<tr><td>counting loop</td>
    <td><p>Uses a loop control variable to count upwards or downwards

    <td><p>Loop keeps going until a test determines that the desired

<h1>Fundamental Loops</h1>

<A NAME="loop flow chart"></A>

<p>
Each  type of loop  can be built using the 
<code>while</code> 
and other statements.
The loops are built out of several  fundamental statements because there
are three things 
(in each of the three types of loops) 
that must be done correctly:
</p>

<A NAME="loop, three conditions"></A>
<ol>
<li>The loop must be initialized correctly.</li>
<li>The ending condition must be tested correcly.</li>
<li>The body of the loop must change the condition that is tested.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Overlooking one of these aspects  results in a
defective loop and a sometimes difficult to find program bug!
Usually each of these three considerations is located in a different spot.
No wonder that loops often go wrong!
</p>

<p>
The flow chart to the right shows what all loops must do.
It could be for any of the three types of loops.
The ellipses 
<nobr>(. . . .)</nobr> 
shows where the loop body  does additional computation.

<p>
Would it be convenient to have all three aspects 
combined into one statement?
