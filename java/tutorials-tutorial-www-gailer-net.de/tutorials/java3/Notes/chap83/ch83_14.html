<h1><code>PrintWriter</code></h1>

<A NAME="PrintWriter"></A>
<p>
The class <code>PrintWriter</code> is used to
deal with the end-of-line problem and other frustrations
of file output.
<code>PrintWriter</code> provides many methods that are
useful for "printing" characters.
("Printing" in this context means sending characters to an output destination,
not usually a hard-copy printer.)
The <code>println()</code> method uses the
approprate line separator for the operating system the program is
running on. 
Often a <code>PrintWriter</code> stream is connected to a 
<code>BufferedWriter</code> stream which is connected to
a <code>FileWriter</code>.

<p>
For small programs where buffering is not needed
the middle pipe (the <code>BufferedWriter</code>)
can be omitted.
</p>

<p>
A further advantage of <code>PrintWriter</code> is that
none of its methods (including <code>println()</code>) throw exceptions.
Usually output is more reliable than input
(because the program has control over its output),
so exception handling is sometimes not needed.
