<p>
It is legal to do this &#8213; but the text will appear in the 
DOS window where <code>println</code> has always put it, 
not in the frame where you want it.

<h1>The <code>drawString()</code> method</h1>
<A NAME="drawString()"></A>
<p>
Ordinarily a child class inherits every method defined in its parent class.
A child <em>overrides</em> a method in its parent by
defining a new method with the same signature.
Now the new method will be used in place of the parent's
method in a child object.

When the Java system needs to paint a <code>myFrame</code> object
it first does most of the work
and then calls <code>paint()</code> in the <code>myFrame</code> 
object to do whatever
extra the programmer wants.
The first part of the work is vital.
It involves interacting with the graphics 
of the computer system and controling the graphics board.
After all of that you get to ask for the little extra bit that
you are interested in.
Our <code>paint()</code> looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
public void paint ( Graphics g )
{
  // draw a String at location x=10 y=50
  g.drawString("A myFrame object", 10, 50 );
} 
</pre>

<p>
The parameter <code>g</code> is a reference to a <code>Graphics</code> object.
The <code>Graphics</code> object represents the part of the frame that you
can draw on.
When the system calls <code>paint()</code>, 
the system gives it this parameter.
One of its methods is 
<nobr><code>drawString(String st, int X, int Y)</code></nobr>
which draws a string on the graphics area at location 
<b>starting</b> X pixels from the
left and Y pixels from the top.
</p>

<p>
Here is <code>MyFrame</code> again, with a few changes.
</p>

<pre class="code">
class myFrame extends Frame
{
  public void paint ( Graphics g )
  {
    g.drawString(<span class="blue">________</span>, <span class="blue">__________</span>, <span class="blue">________</span>);
  }

}
</pre>

<img src="../nextBut.gif" hspace="5" align="right" border="0"/></a>
<p>
Fill in the blanks so that when a <code>myFrame</code> object is drawn it will
contain "Hello" written at the extreme left about halfway
down (assume that the frame is width=150, height=100).
