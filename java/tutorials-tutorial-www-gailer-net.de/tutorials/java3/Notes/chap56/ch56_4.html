<div class="answer">
<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
The program is an application.
It is not called by a Web browser.
It has a <code>main()</code> which is where it starts running.

<h1>Running the GUI Program</h1>
<p>
Even though it does not do much, 
you should run this program and play with it
(one GUI is worth a thousand words).
<b>But first</b> (especially for Windows 95) close any important programs
you might have running (or at least save the game).
You are about to hit <code>control-c</code>,
and this can be dangerous.
</p>

<p>
To run the program,
do this:
first, copy-paste-save the program to a file called
<code>TestFrame1.java</code>.
Then:
</p>

<pre class="program">
C:\> javac TestFrame1.java
C:\> java  TestFrame1
         
     <em>program runs and displays the frame</em>
</pre>


<img src="TestFrame1.gif" hspace="20" vspace="5" align="right"/>

<p>
When the program runs, it displays a frame like the one shown.
If you click on the usual "close button" of the frame,
(the small "X" inside a square)
the picture will vanish, but the program keeps running.
To stop the program,
type control-c in the DOS window.
(You do this by clicking in the DOS window to be sure that
it has focus, then holding down the "Ctrl" key while typing a "c"
character.)
</p>

<pre class="code">
C:\> javac TestFrame1.java
C:\> java  TestFrame1
(control-c)
C:\>
</pre>


<p>
While the program is running, you can click on the frame and drag it
around, you can minimize it, you can grab a border and resize it, and so on.
All of this is built into the <code>JFrame</code> class (inherited from its ancestors).
All you have to do is ask for a <code>JFrame</code> object in your program and you get
all this.

<p>
What do you suppose this line
from the program does?
</p>

<pre>
JFrame frame = new JFrame("Test Frame 1");
