<h1>Frames</h1>

<p>
Let's start with the graphical components.
These must be placed inside a container.
Visually, a container is a rectangular area of the
monitor screen and its components are smaller areas within it.
</p>

<A NAME="frame"></A>
<p>
In Java, a <b>frame</b> is a window that has nice borders, various buttons
along the top border, and other built in things. 
What you usually call a "window" Java calls a "frame".
A frame is a container object,
so GUI components can be placed in it.
</p>

<p>
Like all software objects,
a frame object is actually a section of main memory that holds information
and methods.
With the help of the operating system and the graphics board,
Java paints a picture on the computer monitor that represents the frame.
People often speak as if the frame were the actual picture on the monitor.
In fact, what you see on the monitor is just a graphical
representation of the frame.
</p>

<p>
GUI application programs are usually organized around one or more frames.
