<h1>Web Pages</h1>
<p>
A web page is an ordinary text file.
It can be created with an ordinary text editor
(such as Notepad.)
What makes a web page special is that:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Web pages can be sent from one computer to another across the Internet.</li>
<li>They are viewed with a <b>Web browser</b> (such as Netscape Navigator) which
    presents them in a nice format.</li>
<li>They are linked to other web pages</li>
</ol>


<p>
You probably know all this already.
But,
just for fun, in your web browser click on <code>View/Source</code> to
see the text file behind what the browser is showing.
If you are using 
Internet Explorer this 
will open Notepad  with
the file.
</p>

<p>
The actual text file 
does not look like what you see in the browser.
Notice the <b>HTML tags</b> (such as &lt;p&gt; and  &lt;ol&gt;)
that give the browser information 
about how to display the file.
</p>

<p>
<b>Notes:</b>
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Web pages that have been created using a commercial tool
like <em>Frontpage</em> usually look like gibberish when
you view the source.
But they are still text files.</p></li>
<li><p>Web pages that use <em>frames</em> cannot be viewed using
    <code>View/Source</code>. 
    Often web page authors do this deliberately to hide their
    HTML source from users.</p></li>
<li><p>Although the web page itself is text, tags within it can
    ask for non-text objects to be included, such as:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Images</li>
    <li>Audio clips</li>
    <li>Animation</li>
    </ul></li>
</ol>
