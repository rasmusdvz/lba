Programming Exercises</font></h1></center>
<p>
All these exercises can be done by thoughtfully modifying
(hacking) the example program of the chapter.
</p>

<h2>Exercise 1 --- Guessing Game</h2>
<p>
Modify the <code>Repeater</code> program so that
the user must enter a secret word into the top field.
After each entry, the bottom field either says
"correct" or "wrong!"
After three wrong guesses, exit the program.
</p>
<p>
You will need the <code>equals()</code> method of class <code>String</code> for this
program.

<h2>Exercise 2 -- Error Message</h2>
<p>
Modify the <code>Repeater</code> program so that
when the user enters text into the bottom TextField
and hits enter, the text is replaced with an
error message such as "Enter text in the top field."
</p>
<p>
You will need to modify the <code>actionPerformed( ActionEvent evt )</code>
method so that it determines which text field has just generated
an action.
This can be done by using <code>evt.getActionCommand()</code>,
which evaluates to the <code>String</code> that the user just entered
(no matter in which field it was entered.)
Now use <code>getText()</code> with the top box to see if the string in
that field is the same as the command in the <code>ActionEvent</code>.
If so, copy it to the bottom field.
If not, write the error message.
Be sure to register an <code>ActionListener</code> for each <code>JTextField</code>.

<h2>Exercise 3 -- Echo Both Fields</h2>
<p>
Modify the <code>Repeater</code> program so that
the user can enter text into <em>either</em> field.
The text will be repeated in the other field,
replacing whatever was there.
To do this you will need to use <code>getActionCommand()</code>,
as in Exercise 2.

<h2>Exercise 4 -- Text Swap</h2>
<p>
Add a Button to the GUI.
Modify the program so that when the button is clicked,
the Strings in the two <code>JTextField</code>s are swapped;
ie. the top field gets what was in the bottom box and
the bottom field gets what was in the top.
The <code>actionPerformed()</code> method
will listen for a Button event.
When it gets one, it swaps whatever text is in
the two fields.
