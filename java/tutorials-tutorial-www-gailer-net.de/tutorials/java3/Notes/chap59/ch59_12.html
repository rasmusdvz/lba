<div class="answer">
<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
Button-click events are delivered to the <code>actionPerformed()</code> method,
but it always does the same thing,
regardless of which button is clicked. 
</p>

<h1>Picture of the Problem</h1>
<p>
Look again at the method:
</p>

<pre class="code">
  public void actionPerformed( Action Event evt)
  {
    getContentPane().setBackground( Color.blue );
    repaint();
  }
</pre>
 

<p>
The picture shows the present situation.
Event objects from both buttons are delivered to the
same method,
which changes the background to blue no matter what
event it receives.

<A NAME="setActionCommand()"></A>
<p>
We would like the <code>ActionEvent</code> that is delivered to 
<code>actionPerformed()</code>
to say what should be done.
To do this, you can associate a different command with each button using
</p>

<pre class="code">
setActionCommand(String command)
</pre> 

<p>
Now each button sends its <code>command</code> (a String) as part of 
the <code>ActionEvent</code> when it is clicked.
The <code>actionPerformed()</code> method uses the command to see
what to do.
</p>

<p>
If you don't use <code>setActionCommand()</code> to assign a command to a button,
the command it sends will be the same as its text.
This is usually OK, but is awkward in large projects.
