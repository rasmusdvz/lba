Yes.  Both methods use the same part of an <code>int</code> for

<h1>File Copy Program</h1>

<p>
The next example program is a file copy program.
The text file copy program 
(of two chapters ago)
did character-based IO
with <code>FileReader</code> and <code>FileWriter</code>.
It could not be used for binary files.
The new copy program will do byte-oriented IO
and will work with any file.
The program is invoked from the command line, like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
C:\Programs &gt; java copyBytes sourceFile to destinationFile
</pre>


<p>
As with the previous program,
the "to" argument is there to ensure that the user
has the files in the correct order.
The program operates by reading the original file one byte at a time and
writing to the destination file one byte at a time.
