<h3>A good answer might be:</h3>
<p>
No.  If the file does not open an IOException is thrown and 
then caught by
the outer catch{} block

<h1>Reading and Writing Bytes</h1>

<A NAME="input and output, of bytes"></A>

<p>
Usually data is much more complicated
than the data for the example program.
But the program shows the outer logic that
is needed to read most files.
Sometimes the data in a file 
represents something other than a 
primitive Java type.
For example,
word processor files contain many bytes 
that encode fonts, page formats, and
special symbols.
</p>

<p>
The <code>DataOutputStream</code>
and <code>DataInputStream</code> classes have
several methods for reading and writing single bytes.
Here are two of them:
</p>

<pre class="code">
DataOutputStream:
    public final void writeByte(int b) throws IOException

DataInputStream:
    public final int readUnsignedByte() throws IOException
</pre> 

<p>
<code>writeByte()</code> writes the least significant byte
of its <code>int</code> argument to the output stream.
<code>readUnsignedByte()</code> reads a byte from the input
stream and puts it in the least significant byte of its
return value.
</p>

<h3> QUESTION 13:</h3>
<a href="ch86_14.html">
<img src="../nextBut.gif" hspace="5" align="right" border="0"/></a>
<p>
Could a byte read from a file by  <code>readUnsignedByte()</code>
be written to another file by <code>writeByte()</code>.
