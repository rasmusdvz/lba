<A NAME="paint(), Applet"></A>

<p>
An applet does not have a <code>main()</code> method.
It has a collection of methods that the Web browser
(or <code>appletViewer</code>) calls at appropriate times.
</p>

<p>
The <code>paint()</code> method is called by the Web browser
to draw the rectangular part of the screen that the applet
is responsible for.
The <code>Graphics</code> object that is passed to 
the method represents the rectangular part of the screen
given to the applet.
</p>

<img src="grid.gif" hspace="15" align="right" />
<p>
The dimensions of this rectangle are specified in the
<code>&lt;applet&gt;</code> tag of the Web page.
(More on this, later)
Dimensions are measured in <b>pixels</b>.
The rectangle may be <em>width</em> pixels across and
<em>height</em> pixels in height.
A location in the rectangle is given as
<code>(X,Y)</code> where both are integers.
The (0, 0) location is at the top left.
</p>

<p>
Think of <code>Graphics</code> as representing
a rectangle of graph paper where each small square is
a pixel.
The columns of pixels are numbered 0 to <em>width-1</em>
starting at the left.
The rows of pixels are numbered 0 to <em>height-1</em>
starting at the top.
