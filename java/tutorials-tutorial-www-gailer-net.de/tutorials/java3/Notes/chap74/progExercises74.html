better tool to use with applet graphics than your Web browser.

<h2>Exercise 1</h2>
<p>
Modify the snowflake method so that different levels of
stars are drawn with different colors.
Use colors that are all close to pastel blue.
Do this by changing the pen color based on the size of the star.

<h2>Exercise 2</h2>

<h2>Exercise 3</h2>

<p>
Write a java applet that creates the following figure:
</p>

<center>
<applet code="NestedTriangles.class"  width="400" height="400">
</applet>
</center>

<p>
The only drawing method this figure uses is
<nobr><code>drawLine()</code></nobr>.
The basic figure is a triangle.
But rather than draw the full sized triangle,
draw three half-sized triangles:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
The left vertex of the lower left triangle is the same as the
left vertex of the big triangle.
Its other two vertices are halfway along the bottom and left sides
of the big triangle.
</li>

<li>
The right vertex of the lower right triangle is the same as the
right vertex of the big triangle.
Its other two vertices are halfway along the bottom and right sides
of the big triangle.
</li>

<li>
The top vertex of the top triangle is the same as the
top vertex of the big triangle.
Its other two vertices are halfway along the right and left sides
of the big triangle.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Write a method <nobr><code>drawTriangle( int CenterX, int CenterY, int side )</code></nobr>
that draws a triangle centered at  <nobr><code>(CenterX, CenterY)</code></nobr>
if <code>side</code> is small.
Otherwise, it draws three triangles.
